# CompanyEmployeeTracker
Helps track various attributes different employees of a company have, such as name and salary.

# How to Use
The main class is Company.java where you are able to create new employees; the available employees
being the boss, hourly worker and commission worker. After running the program you have the choice
of entering your own employee information, but there is also the option to see pre-inputted test
data. For inputting your own data you can choose between the three employee types, and then have to
input their names, salary, bonus etc. At the end all of the employee's information will be displayed.
